To keep moving a bit, I have started to run (the only sport that currently fits into my current schedule), 
and as of January 1st 2016, I begun participating in some races. Here they are:

  My very first running race, and I achieved my goal to stay under 30 minutes.
* [Griffin Gallop at Green Fields School](http://gallop.greenfields.org/) Jan 31st 2016: 5k @ 27:58 min.\\
  An improvement. yay!
* [Marana 5k](http://www.azroadrunners.org/races/detail/Marana5000) March 15 2016: 5k @ 27:11 min.\\
  Also an improvement, but now I should really think about how to get faster.
