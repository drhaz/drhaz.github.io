Instead of meticulously maintaining a parallel and ever-updating list here, let me link to the [astrophysics data system](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/filter_database_fq_database=OR&filter_database_fq_database=database%3A%22astronomy%22&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq_database=(database%3A%22astronomy%22)&q=author%3A(%22Harbeck%2C%20D.%22)&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) which does a better job than I can.
