**Daniel Harbeck, Ph.D.**

Currently Head of Instrumentation at the [Las Cumbres Observatory](https://lco.global).

Herding a bunch of CCD controllers, commissioning the NRES fleet of high-resolution spectrographs, integrating the future 2-meter telescope instrument (MuSCAT 3, 4), renewing the 0.4m telescope fleet, and helping everywhere in the observatory as needed.



## Professional activities:


Main Interests: Astronomical instrumentation, observatory operations, data management software. Stellar populations as a tool to understand galaxy formation and evolution. More recently: solar system asteroids, in particular active asteroids and near-earth objects.

### Publications:

* Dissertation (2003): <a href="assets/docs/dissertation_harbeck_2003.pdf">Chemical Inhomogeneities in the Old Stellar Populations of the Local Group</a>
* Papers: Instead of meticulously maintaining a parallel and ever-updating list here, let me link to the [astrophysics data system](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/filter_database_fq_database=OR&filter_database_fq_database=database%3A%22astronomy%22&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq_database=(database%3A%22astronomy%22)&q=author%3A(%22Harbeck%2C%20D.%22)&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) which does a better job than I can. 


### Prior Positions:

* Associate Scientist at the [WIYN Observatory](http://www.wiyn.org), in Tucson, AZ (USA)\\
 From 2005 to 2017, as Project and Instrument Scientist,  I took care of the development and operations of the [WIYN](www.wiyn.org) [One Degree Imager System](http://www.wiyn.org/ODI), first as project scientist, and later as project lead managing hardware upgrades, and overseeing software development for the instrument and its data handling infrastructure.
* Postdoctoral Towns Fellow at the UC Berkeley Space Science Laboratory.
* Postdoctoral McKinney Fellow at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.

### What is that bridge on the top of the site?


The header image on this web page shows the Conde McCullough Memorial Bridge 
in Coos Bay, Oregon.  I simply like that picture, as I have very fond memories of my visits to Coos Bay. [Read more about that bridge on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conde_McCullough_Memorial_Bridge).

Where does "Cowjumping" come from?
===

![cowjumping mural](/assets/images/cowjumping.jpg){: .rightimage height="300px"}
When I was at a meeting at [Ringberg Castle](http://www.schloss-ringberg.de/home) in Bavaria, I saw this mural 
of a man jumping over a cow. It inspired me to claim the domain cowjumping. 
Shortly after that meeting I moved to Wisconsin and learned about cow tipping. There are many things you can do with cows other than just eat them.
