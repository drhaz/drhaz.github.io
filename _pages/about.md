What is that bridge in on top of the site?
====

The header image on this web page shows the Conde McCullough Memorial Bridge 
in Coos Bay, Oregon.  I simply like that picture, as I have very fond memories of my visits to Coos Bay. [Read more about that bridge on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conde_McCullough_Memorial_Bridge).

Where does "Cowjumping" come from?
===

![cowjumping mural](/assets/images/cowjumping.jpg){: .rightimage height="300px"}
When I was at a meeting at [Ringberg Castle](http://www.schloss-ringberg.de/home) in Bavaria, I saw this mural 
of a man jumping over a cow. It inspired me to claim the domain cowjumping. 
Shortly after that meeting I moved to Wisconsin and learned about cow tipping.
Apparently, there are many things you can do with cows other than eating.
