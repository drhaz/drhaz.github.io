A staple dish in our familly is rosehip soup, a dish we usually serve only once a year for Christmas. It is a flavourful,  spiced, and 
sweetened soup that works well during the Holidays, but every year I wonder why we are not havbing it more often. It can be served as an 
apetizer for a meal, but in recent years we just made a big pot of it and simply ate soup for dinner. 

Ingredients for the soup:
 * 500 g Rosehips
 * Water
 * Gluehweingewuerz
 * Milk and heavy whipping cream
 * Cinneamon
 * One lemon (maybe even a Mayer lemon)
 
Ingredients for the Croutons
 * bread
 * butter
 * salt


Preparing the stock:

boil and simmer for about 30-45 minutes. Strain the stock into a fresh pot; I usually apply a bit of pressure on the rosehips in the strainer;
just be careful since the rosehips are very hot and sticky.

Now add the peel of the lemon into the stock and fresh bag of Gluehweingewuerz. I usually let the stock sit over night in a fridge or a cool place. 

Finishing the soup:
