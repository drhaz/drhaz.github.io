A staple dish in our family is rose hip soup, which we usually serve only once a year for Christmas. It is a flavorful,  spiced, and
sweetened soup that works well during the Holidays, but every year I wonder why we are not having it more often. It can be served as an
appetizer for a meal, but in recent years we just made a big pot of it and simply ate soup for dinner.

Ingredients
===


 * 250 g rose hips, seedless
 * 2 liters water
 * Gluehweingewuerz
 * Cinnamon
 * peel of one lemon

 * 2 table spoon replacement sugar (we use half Splenda / Monkfruit)
 * 2 table spoon sugar
 * 1/2 to 1 tea spoon salt
 * 100-150 ml milk / cream mix
 * 1 tea spoon corn starch
 * Gluehweingewuerz
 * juice of one lemon (maybe even a Mayer lemon)

 * dry bread
 * butter
 * salt


Preparing the stock a day early
===

* Start with making the rose hip stock: In a pot, bring the rose hips, cinnamon, and a bag of Gluehweingewuerz  with the water to
boil and simmer for about 30 minutes.

* Strain the stock into a fresh pot; I usually apply a bit of pressure on the rose hips in the strainer to get all taste out; just be careful since the rose hips are very hot and sticky, and do not overdo it, bitter stuff might come out.

* Now add the peel of the lemon into the stock and fresh bag of Gluehweingewuerz. I usually let the stock sit over night in a fridge or a cool place.

Finishing the soup before eating
===

* Remove the spices from the stock, and add the juice of the lemon. Heat the the soup stock. Add the sugar / replacement sugar and dissolve; we will add more sugar as need later on.

* We are binding the soup - add a little bit of water to the corn starch and stir into the soup, and bring it to a short boil. Then reduce the heat, do not boil the soup from here on any more.

* The next step is a bit delicate as we are adding milk into a fairly acidic liquid. Prepare a mug with the milk & cream mixture; the mug should be about 1/3rd full. Slowly add about the equal amount of the soup stock to the mug and mix. Now slowly stir the milk/ soup mixture back into the pot. You should get a rose colored soup.  

* In a final step adjust the seasoning of the soup. Add some salt and sugar to your taste. Without enough sweetener, the soup does not taste well.

* Finally, as the soup is done, prepare croutons in a pan. The key ingredients to good croutons are simple:
  * Plenty of butter!
  * Enough salt!
  * Brown the croutons enough to the point where they almost start to blacken. The soup is sweet and we need a counterpoint to that.

  Enjoy!
