Ingredients
===

 * 70 g butter
 * 20 to 30 g sugar, or half and half sugar / artificial sweetener. Adjust the sweetener level to your preference. 
 * A good pinch of salt

 * 2 eggs
 * juice of 1/2 lemon
 * 3 tablespoon rum
 * 90 ml milk
 
 * 125 g whole wheat flour
 * 1 teaspoon baking powder

 Preparation
 ===
 Let the butter be soft, i.e, microwave for a few seconds or remove it from the fridge in time early enough. Mix butter and sugar well. 

 Slowly, each time adding only a bit of liquid, add the 2 eggs, lemon juice, rum, and milk. 

 Finally, mix the baking powder into the flour, add to the dough, and mix well. Let sit for a few minutes, and then bake in a waffle iron.
