I have released a new version (1.5) of the VisualFitsBrowser. It has a few improvement that should be useful:
* Some documentation in the GitHub wiki page
* Support to send multi-extension FITS files to ds9 as mosaic image iraf.
* Support to send several images to ds9. Just select several images in the table view and select File -> send all to ds9. All images will load, with frame, cmap etc locked between the frames. 
* If there is no ds9 running already, double-click on the greyed out ds9 icon in the menu bar (right side). A new ds9 (if found) will be launched. 
* Updates in the code basis to remove obsolete code.
* Start with undocumented, experimental support for wave front analysis. 

The new version can be downloaded at [github](https://github.com/drhaz/VisualFitsBrowser).  Please follow the instructions there.
