A bit overdue, and I should also post the papers to archive.org at some point, but here are the 2022 SPIE Papers I presented at the SPIE Astronomical Telescopes + Instrumentation 2022 meeting  in Montreal. One paper talks about observatory maintenance during the COVID pandemic when everything shut down, and the other paper talks about how to use telemetry and data metrics to monitor and then allocate resources to observatory operations.
