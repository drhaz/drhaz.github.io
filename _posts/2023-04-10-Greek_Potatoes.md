Ingredients
===

 * 4 bone-in chicken legs 
 * Salt, pepper, red paprika powder, curry powder


 * 1.5 kg yellow potatoes
 * 800 g shallots
 * If desired: Some garlic
 * 250ml vegetable oil
 * juice of three lemon
 * 250 ml white wine
 
 * 200 ml heavy cream
 * 150-200g crumbled feta cheese
 * fresh thyme


Preparation
===

 * Peel the potatoes and dice them into larger pieces, peel the shallots. Place potatoes and shallots into a larger bowl, and add oil, lemon juice, and wine. Mix, and marinade for 2-3 hours.
 * Wait for it...
 * As desired, rub the chicken legs with salt, pepper, some paprika, and curry powder. Pan-fry sharply to brown, then place into a large, deep baking pan.
 * Add potatoes and shallots to the baking pan. Add 4 tablespoons of the marinade.
 * Place the baking pan into the preheated oven (180 deg C) and bake for 60-90 minutes. Watch for fluids; if too dry, add some water. 
 * 10 minutes before the end of time, pour over the cream. Add crumbled feta cheese and some thyme leaves. 
  
Serve with a fresh green salad. The marinated potatoes tend to take a long time to cook, hence I increased the baking time from 45-60 minutes to 60-90 minutes. It may help to pre-microwave those before baking.
