As part of the WIYN One Degree Imager software suite I developed a java tool that allows to look through all
 fits files in a directory, show some key header keywords in a list, and add a text comment to each file. 
Also, double-clicking on a file in the list will send that fits file to a ds9 fits viewer.

I have released the source code and a runnable jar file on [git hub](https://github.com/drhaz/VisualFitsBrowser).  Please follow the instructions there. 
Documentation etc will follow swiftly (or so).
