  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Below are a few spots around Southern Arizona were we like to go to. By its very nature, this list is highly biased, very subjective, and work in progress.</p>

<h1 id="coffee-spots">Coffee Spots</h1>

<ul>
 	<li>
<a href="http://www.ragingsage.com/">Raging Sage</a>  @ Campbell &amp; Grant <br>
            Excellent (stronger) coffee, and best cake in Tucson. My favourite in town.</li>

 	<li>
<a href="http://villagebakehouse.com">Village Bakehouse</a>  @ Oracle &amp; Magee <br>
           A small bakery with good coffee, excellent pastries, sandwiches and soup. We have not yet been able to sample all offerings.</li>

 	<li>
<a href="http://savayacoffee.com/">Savaya coffee</a>  @ Various Locations in Tucson.<br>
           For my taste,  the very best coffee in Tucson. Quite expensive, but worth it.</li>

 	<li>
<a href="http://www.bentleyscoffeehouse.com/">Bentley's house of coffee and tee</a> @ Campbell &amp; Speedway <br>
         I get my lunch there often as it is close to work. A great place for excellent coffee, sandwiches, and soup, and the people are very friendly.</li>

 	<li>
<a href="https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/">Whole Foods</a>  @ Various Locations in Tucson <br>
        We often pick up a coffee at Whole Foods in Tucson. This is much better than the diluted coffee you get at other coffee chains.</li>
</ul>

<p>If everything else fails, there is always Starbucks, of course.</p>

<h1 id="dining">Dining</h1>
<ul>
 	<li>
<a href="http://www.zaynamediterranean.com/">Zayna Mediterranean</a>  @ Alvernon &amp; Speedway <br>
          A small lunch / dining place with superb food. A must-try are the home made potato fries with lemon juice. Parking can be a pain.</li>

 	<li>
<a href="http://curryleaftucson.com/">Curry Leaf</a> @ Grant &amp; Tucson <br>
A small Indian restaurant that serves dosa. Food was good, and service was very firendly.</li>

 	<li>
<a href="http://brushfirebbq.com/">Brushfire</a> @ Campbell &amp; Glenn <br>
Tucson BBQ - excellent food and friendly people.</li>

 	<li>
<a href="http://azgreekhouse.com">Greek House</a>  @ Campbell &amp; Speedway <br>
My other go to place for lunch while at work. Good greek fast food paired with friendly people.</li>

 	<li>
<a href="http://pappoules.com">Pappoule's</a> @ Tucson Foothills Mall <br>
Our other go to place for a fast greek dinner. Good food and also friendly people.</li>

 	<li>Cafe Tremolo @ Tucson Foothills Mall <br>
This is a place that serves really, really, good straight-forward food.</li>

 	<li>
<a href="http://cafepocacosatucson.com/">Cafe Poca Cosa</a> Tucson Downtown <br>
Excellent high-end Mexican food. Not cheap, but worth it.</li>

 	<li>
<a href="http://www.wildgarlicgrill.com/">Wild Garlic Grill</a> @ 1st &amp; Grant <br>
They call it "California French Accent Cuisine", but I think it is a nice place for dining.</li>

 	<li>
<a href="http://www.cafefrancaistucson.com/">Cafe Francais</a> @ Swan &amp; Glenn <br>
Tugged away in the Plaza Palomino shopping center, this is a very nice french cafe / restaurant and bakery. We like it a lot.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="brunch">Brunch</h1>

<ul>
 	<li>
<a class="biz-name" href="http://www.prepandpastry.com/" data-hovercard-id="Fnb57h9ouKgbd5NJ8psY2Q">Prep &amp; Pastry</a>  @ Campbell &amp; Hedrick <br>
Very good food. A bit focussed on alcohol.</li>
 	<li>
<a href="http://ghiniscafe.com/">Ghinis French Cafe</a>  @ Campbell &amp; Ft Lowell <br>
Very nice for breakfast or early lunch. The associated bakery is one of the best in Tucson.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="outdoors">Outdoors</h1>
<ul>
 	<li>River walk in general</li>
 	<li>Sabino Canyon</li>
 	<li>Catalina State Park</li>
