Below are a few spots around Southern California were we find noteworthy. By its very nature, this list is highly biased, very subjective, and work in progress.

Coffee Spots
====

* [Urth Caffe, in Passadena](https://urthcaffe.com/caffe/locations/urth-pasadena)  
  Amazing coffee and pastries. I would like to come back on day and try other foods there. 

Dining
====

* [Yuzu in Torrance, CA]()  
  I would say the best Japanese restaurant I have been to in the USA. It is especially worthwhile to sit at 
  the counter and watch the meals being prepared. Not cheap, and very much worth it.
