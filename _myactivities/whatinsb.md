So we just moved to Santa Barbara and are exploring the area.

Coffee and Breakfast
===

* Java Station @ Hollister &amp; Nogal Dr\\
  A uncomplicated coffee place to hang out and enjoy a good time. The coffee is very good, and sometimes they grill burgers 
  in the back. One of my favourite places. 

* [The French Press](https://www.facebook.com/thefrenchpresscoffee/) @ Hollister &amp; Storke \\
  The atmosphere is a bit sterile on a first glance, but the people working here are very nice and know 
  how to make superb coffee. The pastries are pretty good. The Matcha Late is created from scratch using matcha powder, which really makes for a good taste.

* [Jeannine’s](http://jeannines.com)  @ State Street &amp; S Ontare Rd \\
  The first breakfast / coffee we had in Santa Barbara was here. Coffee is excellent and breakfast items are pretty good.
  Seems to get crowded quickly though, and is a bit on the expensive side!


Grocery shopping, on the nicer side
===
There are the basic groceries, but the Santa Barbara area has some great options to get fresh produce, meat, and bread:

* [The Ventura Meat Company](http://theventurameatcompany.com/) @ Main Street in Ventura\\
  An exceptional selection of grass fed beef, natural pork, and knowledgeable butchers. Feels like Europe, but in California.

* [D'Angelo Bread](http://dangelobread.com/) @ Gutierrez St (a bit of State Street near the 101)\\
  They have a variety of good tasting bread, including a selection of whole grain breads. While shopping for bread you are tempted to sit down for lunch and some pastries. The closest thing to a European baker I had in the US so far. 

* Santa Barbara Farmers Market in Goleta (7004 Market Pl Dr, Sunday mornings)\\
  A variety of local farms offer their produce, which is often organic. The variety is not quite as large as the farmers market near downtown Sana Barbara on Saturdays, but on th bright side, there are no issues to park your car!


Grocery shopping, the basic fare
