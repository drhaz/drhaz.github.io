description: Summary of my running milestones, only a few races at this time

To keep moving a bit, I have started to run (the only sport that currently fits into my current schedule), 
and as of January 1st 2016, I begun participating in some races. Here they are:

2016
=====

* [Marana Egg Nog Jog](http://www.itsyourrace.com/Results.aspx?id=6787) Jan 1st 2016: 5k @ 29:50 min.\\
  My very first running race, and I achieved my goal to stay under 30 minutes.  
* [Griffin Gallop at Green Fields School](http://gallop.greenfields.org/) Jan 31st 2016: 5k @ 27:58 min.\\
  An improvement. yay!  
* [Marana 5k](http://www.azroadrunners.org/results/detail/marana-5000-results-2016) March 15 2016: 5k @ 27:05 (chip) min.\\
  Also an improvement, but now I should really think about how to get faster.  

2017
====

I was a bit slow to get out to run this year. Too much travel and other stuff getting in the
way. Nevertheless, here we go, finally:

* [Marana 5k](http://www.azroadrunners.org/results/detail/marana-5000-results-2017) March 19 2017: 5k @ 27:30 min.\\
  I was expecting much worse given my state of training, so I guess I am happy with this one.
