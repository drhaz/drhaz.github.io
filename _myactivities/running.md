description: Summary of my running milestones, only a few races at this time

To keep moving a bit, I have started to run (the only sport that currently fits into my current schedule), 
and as of January 1st 2016, I begun participating in some races. Here they are:

2016
=====

* [Marana Egg Nog Jog](http://www.itsyourrace.com/Results.aspx?id=6787) Jan 1st 2016: 5k @ 29:50 min.\\
  My very first running race, and I achieved my goal to stay under 30 minutes.  
* [Griffin Gallop at Green Fields School](http://gallop.greenfields.org/) Jan 31st 2016: 5k @ 27:58 min.\\
  An improvement. yay!  
* [Marana 5k](http://www.azroadrunners.org/results/detail/marana-5000-results-2016) March 15 2016: 5k @ 27:05 (chip) min.\\
  Also an improvement, but now I should really think about how to get faster.  

2017
====

I was a bit slow to get out to run this year. Too much travel and other stuff getting in the
way. Nevertheless, here we go, finally:

* [Marana 5k](http://www.azroadrunners.org/results/detail/marana-5000-results-2017) March 19 2017: 5k @ 27:30 min.\\
  I was expecting much worse given my state of training, so I guess I am happy with this one. 
* [Goleta Turkey Trott 4M](http://www.runsantabarbara.com/thanksgiving-4-miler/) Nov 23 2017: 4M @ 36:49 min.\\
  Having picked up running again in California, this was my first local "race".
  Air quotes since this was more of a nice crowd running together than a 
  competitive race. My goal was to keep it under 40 minutes;  Garmin time /
  [Strava segment](https://www.strava.com/segments/6105454) says 36:49 min, my 
  watch said 38:16 min, but that is me struggeling to get the name tag of my
  bib at the end. Waiting for the official result... \\
  It was great to be there!
