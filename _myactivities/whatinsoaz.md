Below are a few spots around Southern Arizona were we liked to go when we lived there. By its very nature, this list is highly biased, very subjective, and work in progress. 

Coffee Spots
====

<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://www.ragingsage.com/">Raging Sage</a>  @ Campbell &amp; Grant <br>
            Excellent (stronger) coffee, and best cake in Tucson. My favourite in town.</li>

 	<li><a href="http://villagebakehouse.com">Village Bakehouse</a>  @ Oracle &amp; Magee <br>
           A small bakery with good coffee, excellent pastries, sandwiches and soup. We have not yet been able to sample all offerings.</li>

 	<li><a href="http://savayacoffee.com/">Savaya coffee</a>  @ Various Locations in Tucson.<br>
           For my taste,  the very best coffee in Tucson. Quite expensive, but worth it.</li>

 	<li><a href="http://www.bentleyscoffeehouse.com/">Bentley's house of coffee and tee</a> @ Campbell &amp; Speedway <br>
         I get my lunch there often as it is close to work. A great place for excellent coffee, sandwiches, and soup, and the people are very friendly.</li>

 	<li><a href="https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/">Whole Foods</a>  @ Various Locations in Tucson <br>
        We often pick up a coffee at Whole Foods in Tucson. This is much better than the diluted coffee you get at other coffee chains.</li>
</ul>

If everything else fails, there is always Starbucks, of course.


Dining
====
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://www.zaynamediterranean.com/">Zayna Mediterranean</a>  @ Alvernon &amp; Speedway <br>

 	<li><a href="http://curryleaftucson.com/">Curry Leaf</a> @ Grant &amp; Tucson <br>
A small Indian restaurant that serves dosa. Food was good, and service was very firendly.</li>

 	<li><a href="http://cafepocacosatucson.com/">Cafe Poca Cosa</a> Tucson Downtown <br>
Excellent high-end Mexican food. Not cheap, but worth it.</li>

 	<li><a href="http://www.wildgarlicgrill.com/">Wild Garlic Grill</a> @ 1st &amp; Grant <br>
They call it "California French Accent Cuisine", but I think it is a nice place for dining.</li>

 	<li><a href="http://www.cafefrancaistucson.com/">Cafe Francais</a> @ Swan &amp; Glenn <br>
