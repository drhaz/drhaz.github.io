Below are a few spots around Southern California were we find noteworthy.
 By its very nature, this list is highly biased, very subjective, and work in progress.



Coffee Spots
----

* [Urth Caffe, in Pasadena](https://urthcaffe.com/caffe/locations/urth-pasadena)  
  Amazing coffee and pastries. I would like to come back one day and try other foods there. Tends to overfilled with people though.




Dining
----

Torrance & Greater L.A.
====

* [Torihei Yakitori Robata Dining](http://torihei-usa.com/torihei.html) \\
  1757 W. Carson st. Torrance, CA  310-781-9407\\
  A excellent Japanese restaurant specializing in Yakitori and Oden. One of the best. Reservation highly recommended. 


* [MANPUKO](http://www.manpukuus.com/torrance/)\\
  1870 W. Carson St., Torrance, CA \\
  The best Yakiniku place so far in the USA. While gyu-kaku is ok, this is a different leage. Expensive but worth it. 



San Diego
=====

* [Tsuruhashi Japanese BBQ](http://places.singleplatform.com/tsuruhashi/menu) San Diego, Convoy St\\
  Nice, small scale Japanese BBQ place. I love the garlic slowly roasted in oil!


General
=====
* [Gyu-Kaku](http://www.gyu-kaku.com/)  
  A Japanese BBQ chain with various places all over the US, in particular in California.  

Outdoors
====

Not much to report yet. However, Torrance beach seems in particular nice.
