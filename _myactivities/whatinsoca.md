Below are a few spots around Southern California were we find noteworthy.
 By its very nature, this list is highly biased, very subjective, and work in progress.



Coffee Spots
====

* [Urth Caffe, in Pasadena](https://urthcaffe.com/caffe/locations/urth-pasadena)  
  Amazing coffee and pastries. I would like to come back one day and try other foods there. 




Dining
====

* [Yuzu in Torrance, CA]()  
  1231 Cabrillo Ave #101, Torrance, CA 90501  
  I would say the best Japanese restaurant I have been to in the USA. It is especially worthwhile to sit at 
  the counter and watch the meals being prepared. Not cheap, and very much worth it. One needs to bring time
  to enjoy and appreciate an evening here.

* [Tsuruhashi Japanese BBQ](http://places.singleplatform.com/tsuruhashi/menu) San Diego, Convoy St\\
  Nice, small scale Japanese BBQ place. I love the garlic slowly roasted in oil!

* [Gyu-Kaku](http://www.gyu-kaku.com/)  
  A Japanese BBQ chain with various places all over the US, in particular in California.  

Outdoors
====

Not much to report yet. However, Torrance beach seems in particular nice.
