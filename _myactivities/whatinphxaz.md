Greater Phoenix is the nearest larger city from Tucson. Here are a few of my favourite spots.


Breakfast Locations
===
* [St Francis](http://stfrancisaz.com)  @  111 E. Camelback Rd. - Phoenix, AZ \\
  A wonderful location to have breakfast on a weekend morning.

* [The Farm at South Mountain, Morning Glory Cafe](http://www.thefarmatsouthmountain.com/morning-glory-patio) \\
  A nice place for a more informal breakfast in a wonderful green (!) outdoor setting. Great when you want to forget the desert around you.


Crepes and Cakes
===
Phoenix has quite a selection of crepe places. So far we made it to these places and liked them:

* [Cupz N Crepes](http://www.cupzncrepes.com/) @  4232 E Chandler Blvd #1, Phoenix, AZ \\
  An great crepe place at the south end of the valley. French-themed inside.

* [Jobot](http://jobotcoffee.com/) @ 918 N. 5TH STREET, PHX \\
  Good selection of crepes, and excellent coffee. The setting is a bit more alternative.

* Arai Pastry @ 1335 W University Dr, Tempe, AZ 85281 \\
  If you are a friend of Japanese strawberry short cake and friends, this is where you want to be. 


Dining
===

* [The Dhaba](http://the-dhaba.com/) @ 1872 E Apache Blvd., Tempe, AZ \\
  Exceptionally great Indian food with daily specials for lunch. A reservation is highly recommended.

* [Woodlands](http://www.woodlandsaz.com/) @ 4980 W. Ray Rd., Suite 10 \\
  The go-to place if you crave Indian dosa. The setting is simple, the food is very good.

* [Cornish Pasty Co](http://www.cornishpastyco.com/) @ 960 W. University Dr.  Tempe, AZ 85281 \\
  An impressive variety of cornish pasty is offered here. Our first encounter was in the small seating area to the side, 
  and we could watch all the fillings being made fresh from scratch. Also great for takeout. There are a few locations over the place.
